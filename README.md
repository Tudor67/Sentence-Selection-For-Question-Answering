# Sentence-Selection-For-Question-Answering
NLP&amp;SSL Project

## Introduction
Sentence selection is an important subtask of the QA (question answering) problem.
The objective of this project is to identify the sentence from a large text or paragraphs,
that contains the correct answer for a given question.


## Datasets
I use the [SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)](1) - a reading comprehension dataset.
First of all, create the folder `./data/squad/` and copy the [train and dev set of SQuAD](1).
An eda of the SQuAD `./eda/squad_dataset_v_1_1.ipynb`.
